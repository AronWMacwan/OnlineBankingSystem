Online Banking System - Project Report

Project Title: Secure Online Banking System with GUI

Project By: Aron Macwan
Course: Bachelor of Computer Engineering
University: Uka Tarsadia University
Date: February 2026

1. Introduction

The Online Banking System project is a Java-based desktop application designed to simulate real-world banking operations in a secure and user-friendly environment. The system allows users to:

Create accounts with unique account numbers.

Deposit and withdraw money.

Transfer funds between accounts.

View transaction history.

Check account balance.

Delete accounts securely.

The application stores account data persistently, ensuring all transactions and user information are saved between sessions.

2. Objectives

Provide a secure banking environment with login/password authentication.

Implement persistent storage to save accounts and transactions.

Develop a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Java Swing.

Allow users to perform essential banking operations safely and efficiently.

Demonstrate object-oriented programming concepts, file handling, and GUI design.

3. System Requirements

Hardware:

Minimum 4 GB RAM

2 GHz processor

100 MB free disk space

Software:

Java SE Development Kit (JDK 8 or above)

IDE: Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans

Operating System: Windows / Linux / macOS

4. Features

Account Creation:

Users can create accounts with account number, holder name, password, and initial balance.

Login Authentication:

Secure login using account number and password.

Displayed in a neat, scrollable text area.

Account Deletion:

Users can delete their account securely using account number and password.

Persistent Storage:

Account data is stored in accounts.dat using Java serialization.

7. Technologies Used

Java SE (Swing, AWT)

File Handling (Serialization for persistent storage)

Object-Oriented Programming

GUI Design (JTabbedPane, GridBagLayout, GridLayout)

9. Conclusion

The project successfully demonstrates a secure, functional online banking system with a modern GUI. It highlights the use of Java OOP concepts, Swing UI design, file handling, and persistent storage. The system is user-friendly, secure, and suitable for demonstration in academic settings.
